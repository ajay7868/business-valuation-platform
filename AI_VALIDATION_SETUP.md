## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Get OpenAI API Key
1. Visit [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Sign up or log in to your account
3. Navigate to "API Keys" section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the key (starts with `sk-`)

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variable

#### Option A: Local Development (.env file)
```bash
# Create .env file in project root
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here" > .env
```

#### Option B: Export in Terminal
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-actual-api-key-here"
```

#### Option C: Vercel Deployment
1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to "Settings" → "Environment Variables"
3. Add new variable:
   - **Name**: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: `sk-your-actual-api-key-here`
4. Redeploy your application

### Step 3: Verify Configuration
```bash
# Test the API key
curl -X POST -F "file=@uploads/test_financial_data.xlsx" http://localhost:5000/api/upload
```

**Expected Response with API Key:**
```json
{
  "ai_validation": {
    "status": "validated",
    "confidence_score": 85.0,
    "validation_notes": [
      "Revenue to EBITDA ratio is reasonable for manufacturing industry",
      "Asset turnover ratio appears consistent with industry standards",
      "Employee count aligns with revenue scale"
    ],
    "industry_analysis": "Manufacturing industry benchmarks suggest these metrics are within normal ranges",
    "recommendations": [
      "Verify inventory valuation methods",
      "Confirm accounts receivable aging"
    ],
    "risk_level": "low"
  },
  "extracted_data": { ... },
  "status": "success"
}
```

## 📊 Validation Examples

### High Confidence Data (90-100%)
- Financial ratios are industry-typical
- Data relationships are logical
- No obvious red flags

### Medium Confidence Data (70-89%)

### Industry Benchmarks
- Revenue per employee
- Asset utilization ratios
- Profit margin ranges
- Growth rate expectations

### Data Consistency
- Logical relationships between metrics
- Reasonable growth patterns
- Appropriate scale for industry

### Error Messages

#### "OpenAI API key not configured"
- Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
- Restart your application after setting

#### "Rate limit exceeded"
- Wait before making more requests
- Consider upgrading your OpenAI plan

#### "Model not available"
- Check OpenAI service status
- Verify model name in code
